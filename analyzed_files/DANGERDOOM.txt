Crystal clear to the jot, or the tittle
Sssst! It's hot off the griddle
Came to take the cake whether it's a lot, or a little
Kaboom; DOOM is nervous large
You could tell by his blooming room service charge

The Mask
##########

I got a mom and a dad and they are out back
We sit by the pool and we nibble on snacks
Then we eat a big lunch and we all take naps!
Why'd the beat stop? Hey! Hey!
I got a mask too so gimme the mic!

On some junk like Gucci on a classy ho
Might splash you in the face with nuclear pistachio
Make a fast break, or that'll be the last mistake
That ass'll make is what you get for messin with Master Shake
Look out, don't block the screen son, lunge across

Old School Rules Lyrics[Intro: Talib Kweli]
Lord, I can't take it no' mo'
One two three, in the place to be!
MF DOOM, Talib Kweli, ah here we go

DOOM, your reputation precedes you
Wait 'til you crack and see what "weed" do, you dweeb you
No pun intended, takes one to know one, well no - it's unscented
Yo son, demented when them sent it from the other time
Before everybody and they mother rhyme


Don't play it out or spray it when you say it out your mouth
Then gave him a cold shoulder for a hour
And told him take a gold shower for fakin' funk, soul power
Stocky, short and cocky
Looked like Apollo Kreig after he fought with Rocky


And DOOM, maybe it's him
Called up my lady, told her "Baby, it's slim"
Make me up a margarita, I need to take a swim
Tell them kids remember school - if they let 'em out, cool
But get the hell from out the pool


AND I HATE YOUR SUCKY STUPID METAL FACE!
I hope you burn, you're going down
This is the last big mistake, you'll ever make
YOU SUCK! I HATE YOUR GUTS!
But, if there is another project in the future please keep me in mind

No bull, everything he wanted they grabbed and took
Whole lab looked like an ill left jab and hook
Even had a secretary to take the calls
Shake it and make it fall, I told her don't break my balls
Wherever Mouse go, trouble follows


Basket Case
##########

Diagnosed as shell shocked from totin' toast
And still could hear the bells rock Doc, another Lodine dose
He claimed he couldn't take the racket
Faked his own escape in a eightball straight jacket
[Interlude: Myron Reducto & Harvey Birdman]


Villain, man in the mask, spit in the face
Show him where to go, inside a hand basket case
[Outro: Myron Reducto, Harvey Birdman, Mentok the Mindtaker & MF DOOM]
The defendant's confession!
Uhh, nothing further

Vats of Urine

It's not the kind of stuff you want to save and harbor away
Once it gets ripened and fermented
It takes on a bouquet that I should say is naturally scented
Tempted by an empty can of Guinness
Or waiting until we get there, say two or three minutes


Mad Nice
##########

Now I be the top shotter, heart of a Rottweiler
The boss that learned to move cautious as Assata
I don't take shit for granted, I'm strong single-handed
And I ain't quick to panic, but I can't lift the planet
My one and only concern is that ya'll understand it

Who's fault is it if her face taste like Vazoplex?
It ain't funny
Ever since a young'un sonny, take the money
His first business made each day a grand
His only comp, shorty with the spiked lemonade stand

Sherman stinks so put some hot sauce on your niece
(or what?) Or Nephew, I hope he got a 12 for his sake
Made a wrong turn into a hole, hell of a mistake
Animals in the car had made a piss lake
Must of interfered with the wiring on the disc brakes

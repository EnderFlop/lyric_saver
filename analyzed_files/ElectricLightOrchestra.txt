You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here
But can you take me back?
In sight, the image of your light
That now is day and once was night

You brought me here
But can you take me back again?
[Pre-Chorus]
With your head held high

Although it's only a day since I was taken away

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne]
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living


[Chorus: Jeff Lynne, Jeff Lynne and Kelly Groucutt]
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living4

Long Black Road
##########

You gotta realise all your responsibilities
You gotta get out to work and face reality."
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road, long black road
So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin


I saw a lot of people coming back the other way
So I kept on goin' when I heard them say
"You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road."
Long black road, long black road


But they all told me, money wouldn't bring me happiness
"You gotta work like a man in a real man's life
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife."
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road


"You gotta work like a man in a real man's life
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife."
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load


You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load


You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road
You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road, long black road, long black road

Mr. Blue Sky Lyrics[Intro]
(Good morning!)
(Today's forecast calls for blue skies!)

The sun is shining in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped raining, everybody's in the play
And don't you know it's a beautiful new day, hey

Running down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city, on the streets where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today, hey

Evil Woman
Evil Woman Lyrics[Intro]
You made a fool of me, but them broken dreams have got to end

[Verse 1]
Hey woman, you got the blues
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use
There's an open road that leads nowhere
So just make some miles between here and there
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in
You took my body and played to win
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame
But you ain't got nobody else to blame
[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman

[Verse 2]
Rolled in from another town
Hit some gold, too hot to settle down
But a fool and his money soon go separate ways
You found a fool lyin' in a daze
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you
It's so good that you're feeling pain
But you better get your face on board the very next train

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)

Evil woman, how you done me wrong
But now you're tryin' to wail a different song
Ha, ha, funny how you broke me up
You made the wine, now you drink the cup
I came runnin' every time you cried
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes
Ha, ha, very nice to know
That you ain't got no place left to go

[Chorus]
Evil woman
Evil woman
Evil woman (you're an evil woman)

When I Was a Boy
When I Was a Boy Lyrics[Verse 1]
When I was a boy, I had a dream
All about the things I'd like to be
Soon as I was in my bed
Music played inside my head
When I was a boy, I had a dream

[Verse 2]
When I was a boy, I learned to play
Far into the night and drift away
Don't want to work on the milk or the bread
Just want to play my guitar instead
When I was a boy, I had a dream
[Chorus]
And radio waves kept me company
In those beautiful days when there was no money
When I was a boy, I had a dream

[Verse 3]
When I was a boy, I had a dream
Finding out what life could really mean
Don't want a job 'cause it drives me crazy
Just wanna sing, "Do you love me, baby?"
When I was a boy, I had a dream

[Chorus]
And radio waves kept me company
In those beautiful days when there was no money
When I was a boy, I had a dream

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
When I was a boy2



Turn to Stone
Turn to Stone Lyrics[Verse 1]
The city streets are empty now
(The lights don't shine no more)
And so the songs are way down low
(Turning, turning, turning)
A sound that flows into my mind
(The echoes of the daylight)
Of everything that is alive
(In my blue world)

[Chorus]
I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home?
I can't go on
[Verse 2]
The dying embers of the night
(A fire that slowly fades till dawn)
Still glow upon the wall so bright
(Turning, turning, turning)
The tired streets that hide away
(From here to everywhere they go)
Roll past my door into the day
In my blue world

[Chorus]
I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone

[Bridge]
(Yes, I'm turnin' to stone 'cause you ain't comin' home
Why ain't you comin' home If I'm turnin' to stone
You've been gone for so long and I can't carry on
Yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin', I'm turnin' to stone)

[Verse 3]
The dancing shadows on the wall
(The two step in the hall)
Are all I've seen since you've been gone
(Turning, turning, turning)
Through all I sit here and I wait
(I turn to stone, I turn to stone)
You will return again someday
To my blue world
[Chorus]
I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
I turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone
Turn to stone, when you comin' home?
I can't go on
Turn to stone, when you are gone
I turn to stone4

And I heard these voices calling all over the world

It was 9:29
9:29, back street, big city
The sun was going down
There was music all around
It felt so right

Nothing else that I could do
I should've been away

Can’t Get It Out of My Head
Can’t Get It Out of My Head Lyrics[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Midnight on the water
I saw the ocean's daughter
Walking on a wave she came
Staring as she called my name

And I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head

Breakdown on the shoreline
Can't move, it's an ebb tide
Morning don't get here 'til night
Searching for her silver light

No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead
'Cause I can't get it out of my head, no, no

Bank job in the city
Robin Hood and William Tell, Ivanhoe and Lancelot
They don't envy me, yeah
Sitting 'til the sun goes down
In dreams, the world keeps going
'Round and 'round

No, I can't get it out of my head
Now my old world is gone for dead

Showdown
Showdown Lyrics[Verse 1]
She cried to the southern wind
'Bout a love that was sure to end
Every dream in her heart was gone
Headin' for a showdown
Bad dreamer, what's your name?
Looks like we're ridin' on the same train
Looks as though there'll be more pain
There's gonna be a showdown

[Chorus]
And it's rainin' all over the world
It's rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night
[Verse 2]
She came to me like a friend
She blew in on a southern wind
Now my heart is turned to stone again
There's gonna be a showdown
Save me
Oh, save me
It's unreal, the suffering
There's gonna be a showdown

And it's rainin' all over the world
Rainin' all over the world
Tonight, the longest night

Twilight
Twilight Lyrics[Verse 1]
The visions dancing in my mind
The early dawn, the shades of time
Twilight crawling through my windowpane
Am I awake or do I dream
The strangest pictures I have seen?
Night is day, and twilight's gone away

[Pre-Chorus]
With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)
[Chorus]
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

[Verse 2]
Across the night, I saw your face
You disappeared without a trace
You brought me here
But can you take me back?
In sight, the image of your light
That now is day and once was night
You lead me here, and then you go away

[Pre-Chorus]
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)

[Chorus]
(Twilight, twilight)
(Twilight) I gave you time
To steal my mind
Away from me

[Bridge]
You brought me here
But can you take me back again?
[Pre-Chorus]
With your head held high
And your scarlet lies
You came down to me
From the open skies
(It's either real or it's a dream)
(There's nothing that is in between)

[Chorus]
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile
Twilight, I gave you time
To steal my mind

[Chorus]
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile
(Twilight) I only meant to stay awhile

[Outro]

Yours Truly, 2095
Yours Truly, 2095 Lyrics[Intro]
(2095, 2095, 2095, 2095)
I love you, sincerely
Yours truly, yours truly

[Verse 1]
I sent a message to another time
But as the days unwind
This I just can't believe
I sent a note across another plane
Maybe it's all a game
But this I just can't conceive
(Can you hear me?)
[Verse 2]
I drive the very latest hovercar
I don't know where you are
But I miss you so much 'til then
I met someone who looks a lot like you
She does the things you do
But she is an IBM

[Pre-Chorus]
(2095, 2095, 2095, 2095)
I love you, sincerely
Yours truly, yours truly

[Verse 3]
She's only programmed to be very nice
But she's as cold as ice
Whenever I get too near
She tells me that she likes me very much
But when I try to touch
She makes it all too clear

[Verse 4]
She is the latest in technology
Almost mythology
But she has a heart of stone
She has an IQ of 1001
She has a jumpsuit on
And she's also a telephone
[Pre-Chorus]
(2095, 2095, 2095, 2095)
I love you, sincerely
Yours truly, yours truly

[Chorus]
Is that what you want?
(Is it what you want?)
Is it what you really want?
(Is it what you really want?)
Is that what you want?
(Is it what you want?)
Is it what you really want?

[Verse 5]
I realize that it must seem so strange
That time has rearranged
But time has the final word
She knows I think of you, she reads my mind
She tries to be unkind
She knows nothing of our world

[Verse 6]
Although her memory banks overflow
No one would ever know
For all she says, "Is that what you want?"
Maybe one day, I'll feel her cold embrace
And kiss her interface
'Til then, I'll leave her alone
[Pre-Chorus]
I love you, sincerely
Yours truly, yours truly

Do Ya
Do Ya Lyrics[Intro]
Well

[Verse 1]
In this life, I've seen everything I can see, woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sun
And I've seen dreams that came from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men crying at their own grave sides
And I've seen pigs all sitting watching picture slides
But I never seen nothin' like you
[Chorus]
Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?

[Verse 2]
Well I heard the crowd singin' out of tune
As they sat and sang 'Auld Lang Syne' by the light of the moon
I heard the preacher bangin' on the drums
And I heard the police playin' with their guns
But I never heard nothing like you

{Bridge}
In the country where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn

[Bridge]

But I never seen nothin' like you

[Chorus]
Do ya, do ya want my love? (Woman)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (I'm sayin')
Do ya, do ya want my love?
[Verse 3]
Well, I think you know what I'm trying to say, woman
That is, I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of the world to know
That I've got to get it all to get it all to grow

[Chorus]
Do ya, do ya want my love? (Come on now)
Do ya, do ya want my face? (I need it)
Do ya, do ya want my mind? (Alright now)
Do ya, do ya want my blood?

[Outro]
Oh, look out
Do ya, do ya want my love?
Do ya, do ya want my love?
Oh-oh5



Shangri-La
Shangri-La Lyrics[Intro]
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

[Verse 1]
Sitting here, waiting for
Someone calling at my door
Too bad
I'm getting out of love

[Verse 2]
What's the use of changing things?
Wonder what tomorrow brings
Who knows?
I'm getting out of love
[Chorus]
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue

[Interlude]
Duh-dah-deh-de-doo-deh-doo
I'm getting out, I'm getting out

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Clouds roll by and hide the sun
Raindrops falling on everyone
So sad
I'm getting out of love
Yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude"
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue (the blue, the blue)
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
My Shangri-La has gone away
Fading like The Beatles on "Hey Jude" (Do me, baby!)
She seemed to drift out on the rain
That came in somewhere softly from the blue
[Bridge]
I'm getting out of love
Where is my Shangri-La?
Doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-dah-dey
Where is my Shangri-La?
I'm getting out of love

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
I will return
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La
(I will return)
I will return to Shangri-La



Ticket to the Moon
Ticket to the Moon Lyrics[Verse 1]
Remember the good old 1980s?
When things were so uncomplicated?
I wish I could go back there again
And everything could be the same

[Verse 2]
I've got a ticket to the moon
I'll be leaving here any day soon
Yeah, I've got a ticket to the moon
But I'd rather see the sunrise
In your eyes
[Verse 3]
Got a ticket to the moon
I'll be rising high above the earth so soon
And the tears I cry might turn into the rain
That gently falls upon your window
You'll never know

[Chorus]
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)

[Bridge]
Fly, fly, through a troubled sky
Up to a new world, shining bright
Whoa, whoa

[Verse 4]
Flying high above
Soaring madly through the mysteries that come
Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here
Could turn around and I would see you there?
(And I would see you there, waiting) Standing there

[Verse 5]
Ticket to the moon
Flight leaves here today from Satellite Two
As the minutes go by, what should I do?
I paid the fare, what more can I say?
It's just one way (Only one way)
[Chorus]
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)

[Outro]
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)
Ticket to the moon (Ticket to the moon)...

Rockaria!
Rockaria! Lyrics[Intro: Mary Thomas]
Weit (Oops!)
Weit, weit in die Ferne
Man hört, man hört die Musik

[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne]
Just got back from the downtown Palais
Where the music was so sweet
It knocked me right back in the alley
I'm ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Woah, woah, woah, I'm ready
And I'm really gonna rock tonight
[Verse 2]
Sweet little lady sings like a songbird
And she sings the opera like you ain't never heard
But she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
No, no, no, she ain't ready
And she ain't gonna rock and roll

[Chorus]
She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room

[Interlude: Mary Thomas]
Weit, weit in die Ferne
Man hört, man hört die Musik

[Verse 3: Jeff Lynne]
Come on I'll show you how to sing the blues
Now baby, come on over you got nothing to lose
Are you ready, hey, hey, hey are you ready?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, are you ready?
I wanna show you how to rock and roll

[Verse 4]
Now listen here baby she, said to me
Just, meet me at the opera house at quarter to three
'Cause I'm ready, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ready
Woo, hoo, hoo, I'm ready
I'm gonna show you how to sing the blues
[Chorus]
She's sweet on Wagner
I think she'd die for Beethoven
She loves the way Puccini lays down a tune
And Verdi's always creeping from her room

[Bridge]
Oh, far, far away
The music is playin'

[Outro]
Well, we were reelin' and rockin' all through the night
Yeah, we were rockin' at the opera house until the break of light
And the orchestra was playin' all Chuck Berry's greatest tunes
And the singers in the chorus all got off on them singin' blues
And as the night grew older everybody was as one
The people on the streets came runnin' in to join in song
Just to hearing the opera singers singing rock and roll so pure
I thought I saw the mayor there but I wasn't really sure
But it's alright

Mumblin' and fumblin'

Well
Listen everybody, let me tell you 'bout the rock n' roll
Ohhh, feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul
Mmmm, come along with me, to a land of make-believe

Midnight Blue
Midnight Blue LyricsMidnight blue
Midnight blue

I see the lonely road that leads so far away
I see the distant lights that left behind the day
But what I see is so much more than I can say
And I see you in midnight blue

I see you cryin' now, you've found a lot of pain
And what you're searchin' for can never be the same
But what's the difference 'cause they say what's in a name?
And I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

I see you standing there far out along the way
I want to touch you, but the night becomes the day
I count the words that I am never gonna say
And I see you in midnight blue

I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

Can't you feel the love that I'm offering you?
Can't you see how it's meant to be?
Can't you hear the words that I'm saying to you?
Can't you believe like I believe?
It's only one and one, it's true
Still I see you in midnight blue
(Midnight blue)

I see (I see) beautiful days
And I feel (I feel) beautiful ways
Of loving you, everything's midnight blue
I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue

I will (I will) love you tonight
And I will (I will) stay by your side
Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue2



Jungle
Jungle Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was standing in the jungle
I was feeling alright
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
I was wandering in the darkness
In the middle of the night
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
The moon began to shine
I saw a clearing ahead
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
But what's that going on?
I think I'm out of my head
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
[Chorus]
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
Looka looka, koo la ley

[Verse 2]
A hundred animals
Were gathered 'round this night
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
And they were singing out a lovely song
Under the pale moonlight
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
I stood and stared for quite a while
Then a lion sang to me and smiled
"Come and join us if you so desire"

[Chorus]
(They sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley
(And they turned away)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

[Verse 3]
I said, "Now please explain the meaning
Of this song you sing"
Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm
"Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!"
[Chorus]
(Oh, they sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

[Interlude]
(Ah, that's nice)
(And they danced!)

[Verse 4]
Pretty soon, I knew the tune
And we sat and sang under the moon
And the jungle rang in joyful harmony

[Chorus]
(They sang)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley
(And they turned away)
Chooka chooka, hoo la ley
(That's what they sang)
Looka looka, koo la ley

[Outro]
Wondrous is our great blue ship
That sails around the mighty sun
And joy to everyone that rides along!
(Chooka chooka, hoo la ley)2



Prologue
Prologue Lyrics[Intro]
Just on the border of your waking mind
There lies another time
Where darkness and light are one
And as you tread the halls of sanity
You feel so glad to be
Unable to go beyond
I have a message from another time



Big Wheels
Big Wheels Lyrics[Vocoder Intro]
Big wheels
Keep turning
They turn forever and ever

[Verse 1]
I've been thinkin' it over
So many times they say
You got it made
They never understand
The answer lies within your soul
Cause no one know which side
The coin will fall
[Chorus]
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Or not at all)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'

[Verse 2]
Save it for a rainy day
For when the cold wind blows
Just to see how they run
I thought they'd know
I tried my best
All I could do
But somehow, it was not enough for you

[Chorus]
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Not enough for you)
Big wheels turnin' (no, no, no)
Baby, I know (no, no, no)
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'
[Bridge]
I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines
Upon the window
I see it all so clear
The tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days
I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin'
Never endin', on and on they go

[Verse 3]
I think I'm goin' home
I think I'm gonna have to start again
It's rather sad
Because I've looked around
Can't seem to find
Whatever's always rollin'
Through my mind
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
(Through my mind)
Big wheels turnin'
Baby, I know
Big wheels turnin', turnin'
Turnin', turnin', turnin'
[Bridge]
I remember the dead of night
A lonely light that shines
Upon the window
I see it all so clear
The tenderness, the silent tears
Out here in the pouring rain
Through cold dark waiting days
I see you standing there
I see the big wheels turnin'
Never endin', on and on they go

[Vocoder Outro]
Big wheels... big wheels



Eldorado
Eldorado Lyrics[Verse 1]
Here it comes, another lonely day
Playing the game, I'll sail away
On a voyage of no return to see
If eternal life is meant to be
And if I find the key
To the eternal dream

[Verse 2]
The painted ladies of the Avalon
Play in the sun, take to the road
To the north, there lies the chills of cold
To the south, there lies the tales untold
Oh, but in between, there lies
The place to close your eyes
[Chorus 1]
And I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado

[Verse 3]
"Say goodbye," the city's heroes sing
Bird on the wing, feel, feel so free
Oh, the life upon the rooftop haze
All the cheating and the broken days
So through it all, I see
There's nothing left for me

[Chorus 2]
So I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado

[Verse 4]
Sitting here on top of everywhere
What do I care? Days never end
Though the voyage's end will soon be here
No eternal life is here for me
Oh, and now I found the key
To the eternal dream
[Chorus 3]
Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado
I will be free
Of the world, Eldorado
Then I will stay
I'll not be back, Eldorado



It’s Over
It’s Over Lyrics[Intro]
It's over, it's over, it's over

[Verse 1]
Summer came and passed away
Hardly seemed to last a day
But it's over, and what can I do?
Music playing in the air
Silence on a darkened stair
'Cause it's over, and what can I do?
[Chorus]
It's over, it's over, all over
It's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down
It's over
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of

[Bridge]
Feeling down, down
It's all over
Feeling down, down, down
Baby, baby, it's all gone
Rolled out to sea

[Verse 2]
Looking over sunny days (Searching, searching)
Searching for the righteous wave
'Cause it's over, all gone what can I do?
Looking from this distant shore (Distant shore)
You ain't sailing by no more
'Cause it's over (It is over) and what can I do?

[Chorus]
It's over, it's over, all over
It's all over now
And the way you looked don't even mean I'm down
It's over, over, it's over
When you kick out the sea and the sun says goodbye
There is nothing much to speak of
[Bridge]
Feeling down, down
It's over
Feeling down, down, down

[Instrumental solo]

[Chorus]
Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over
It's all over and what can I do?
Ah, it's over, it's over
It's all over

[Outro]
Oh, it's over, it's over
Don't shed a tear for me, it's over
Don't shed a tear although it's over

10538 Overture
10538 Overture Lyrics[Verse 1]
Did you see your friend
Crying from his eyes today?
Did you see him run
Through the streets and far away, aah?
Did you see him run?
Did you see him fall? (Aah, aah, aah)
Did his life flash by
At the bedroom door? (Aah, aah)

[Bridge]
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
[Verse 2]
Did you hear the news?
It came across the air today
Someone had been found
On the rocks down in the bay, aah
Did you see him hide?
Did you see him crawl? (Aah, aah, aah)
Does his life mean more
Than it did before? (Aah, aah)

[Bridge]
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)
(Aah-aah-aah-aah)

Did you see that man
Running through the streets today?
Did you catch his face?

Tightrope
Tightrope Lyrics[Verse 1]
They say some days you're gonna win
They say some days you're gonna lose
I tell you I got news for you
You're losing all the time, you'll never win, no
If you believe that's how it's gonna be, I'd better put you down
Get off your tightrope up there, come down on the ground
You gotta save me now, you better turn around

[Chorus]
(Woo!)
When I looked around (looked around, woo!)
I was heading down
Won't somebody throw me down a line
[Interlude]
(He-he-hey!)
(He-he-hey!)

[Verse 2]
They say some days you gotta give (He-he-hey!)
They say some days you gotta take (He-he-hey!)
If that's the way it's gotta be (He-he-hey!)
Roll it over and you will see (He-he-hey!)

[Bridge]
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time
The change from night to day is really only hours
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign

[Chorus]
(Woo!)
When I looked around (looked around, woo!)
I was heading down
Won't somebody throw me down a line

[Verse 3]
I want to look you straight in the eye (He-he-hey!)
I want to tell you how I really feel (He-he-hey!)
I can feel the wheels turning around (He-he-hey!)
Won't somebody throw me down a line (He-he-hey!)
[Bridge]
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time
The change from night to day is really only hours
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign

[Outro]
(Woo!)
When I closed my eyes (closed my eyes, woo!), I was so surprised
Somebody had thrown me down the line, stopped me drowning
Somebody had thrown me down the line
(Somebody)



The Way Life’s Meant to Be
The Way Life’s Meant to Be Lyrics[Verse 1]
Well, I came a long way to be here today
And I left you so long on this avenue
And here I stand in the strangest land
Not knowing what to say or do
As I gaze around at these strangers in town
I guess the only stranger is me

[Chorus]
And I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?
[Verse 2]
Although it's only a day since I was taken away
And left standing here looking in wonder
(It's your life, it's your life)
Oh, the ground at my feet
Maybe it's just the old street
But everything that I know lies under
(It's your life, it's your life)
And when I see what they've done
To this place that was home
Shame is all that I feel, oh

[Chorus]
And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Wonder, wonder, wonder, wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?

[Bridge]
Too late, too late to cry, the people say
Too late for you, too late for me
"You've come so far, now you know everything, my friend"
(Look and see the wonders of our world)

[Chorus]
And I wonder (Oh, I wonder)
Yes, I wonder (Yes, I wonder)
Is this the way life's meant to be?
[Verse 3]
As I wander around this wreck of a town
Where people never speak aloud
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers
I wish I was back in 1981
Just to see your face instead of this place
Now I know what you mean to me, ooh

I wanna know, now
Is this the way life's meant to be?4



Confusion
Confusion Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everywhere the sun is shining
All around the world, it's shining
But cold winds blow across your mind

[Chorus]
Confusion (confusion) - it's such a terrible shame
Confusion (confusion) - you don't know what you're saying
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)
[Verse 2]
Every night you're out there, darling
You're always out there running
And I see that lost look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Confusion (confusion) - I don't know what I should do
Confusion (confusion) - I leave it all up to you
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)

[Verse 3]
Dark is the road you wander
And as you stand there under
The starry sky, you feel sad inside

[Chorus]
Confusion (confusion) - you know, it's driving me wild
Confusion (confusion) - it comes as no big surprise
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on
(Can't carry on)
You feel there's no one there for you to lean on
(To lean on)
[Outro]
Confusion, confusion
Confusion, confusion



Shine a Little Love
Shine a Little Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
Although the things you've done, I wouldn't criticize
I guess you had your way
You see, I gotta make you understand

[Pre-Chorus]
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say
But it don't matter, baby
'Cause today's another day

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life

Can you feel it's right (I know it is)
Will you be the same (I'll do it all again)
Hu, hu, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu-ha, hu

[Verse 3]
It's been a year now and it's gettin' so much better
Came home without a word
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her
[Pre-Chorus]
They couldn't see and they just didn't understand
And lookin' in the mirror
There were fools at either hand

You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Bridge]
Can you understand (yes, I understand)
Can you feel it's right (I know it is)

Hu-ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hu-aah, hu

How many days had I been waitin' there to tell you
I really can't believe
We're walkin' out into the world tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
We'll do it all again until the break of light
And the feeling in your heart
Will soon be shinin' in your eyes
[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Shine on me)
You shine a little love on my life (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see

[Chorus]
You shine a little love on my life (Shine)
You shine a little love on my life (E.L.O.)
You shine a little love on my life
And let me see



Wild West Hero
Wild West Hero Lyrics[Intro]
Wish I was, yeah
A Wild West hero

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I look up high
And then I think there might
Just be a better life
Away from all we know
That's where I wanna go
Out on the wild side
[Pre-Chorus]
And I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero
[Chorus]
Ride the range all the day
'Til the first fading light
Be with my western girl
'Round the fire, oh, so bright
I'd be the Indians' friend
Let them live to be free
Ridin' into the sunset
I wish I could be
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I'd ride the desert sands
And through the prairie lands
Tryin' to do what's right
The folks would come to me
They'd say, "We need you here"
I'd stay there for the night

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I wish I was
Oh-oh-oh-oh, a Wild West hero
[Chorus]
Ride the range all the day

So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away
Starlight, your eyes
Are lookin' down on me
So far away...2



Rain Is Falling
Rain Is Falling Lyrics[Intro]
(Rain, rain, go away)
(Come again another day)

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning
The sun was up and the sky was very blue
Without a warning
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you
A noise in the city made the children run
And hide themselves away
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky
[Verse 2]
Looking from this window
A thousand rivers running past my door
Standing on an island
Looking for someone upon the shore
I can see it very clearly
Nothing's really changed
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky

[Chorus]
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?
(It's raining, it's pouring)
(The old man is snoring)

[Verse 3]
With their brand new time transporter
They'll think maybe I fought to get away
But with all their great inventions
And all their good intentions, here I stay
Down on the corner, where the sun had shone
The people gathered 'round
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground
[Chorus]
Ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, the rain is falling
Said ooh, the rain is falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?
(It's raining, it's pouring)
(The old man is snoring)

[Chorus]
Ooh, the rain is falling
I said ooh, the rain is falling
Ooh, rain keeps on falling, falling
Will it wash away those lonely tears?

[Outro]
(It's raining, it's pouring)
(The old man is snoring)
(Rain, rain, go away)
(Come again another day)2



Steppin’ Out
Steppin’ Out Lyrics[Verse 1]
Pack up all your things
We're gonna be leavin'
Sooner than I thought
Take the things you bought
Clouds are gathering
Say goodbye to all your friends
We're gonna be sorry
For a while, that's how it goes
But then again, who knows
About the rain?
[Chorus]
I'm steppin' out, I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
I'm steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody...
Ooh, I'm steppin' out

[Verse 2]
Did you hear what he said?
He said they sold me down the river
They thought I thought I was a fool
They said the rain would fall
What did they know?
Then I saw your face
Heard the song that you were singin'
Though I thought I knew the words
The tune was quite absurd
And out of key
Doo-dah-dah-dee

[Chorus]
I'm steppin' out, I'm moving on
I'm gonna see the world
Like a rolling stone
I'm steppin' out
I'm gonna be somebody...
Ooh, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out, I'm steppin' out

Steppin' out
Steppin' out
Steppin' out

Don't know where I'm going
Gonna see the world
Gonna be somebody...
Don't know where I'm going
I'm just steppin' out
I'm steppin' out
I'm steppin' out



21st Century Man
21st Century Man Lyrics[Verse 1]
A penny in your pocket
Suitcase in your hand
They won't get you very far
Now you're a 21st century man

[Verse 2]
Fly across the city
Rise above the land
You can do 'most anything
Now you're a 21st century man
[Chorus]
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow
(Tomorrow)
You still wander the fields of your sorrow
What will it bring?

[Verse 3]
One day, you're a hero
Next day, you're a clown
There's nothing that is in-between
Now you're a 21st century man

[Verse 4]
You should be so happy
You should be so glad
So why are you so lonely
You 21st century man?

[Alternate Chorus]
You stepped out of a dream
Believing everything was gone
Return with what you've learned
They'll kiss the ground you walk upon

[Interlude]
(21st century man)
[Verse 5]
Things ain't how you thought they were
Nothing have you planned
So pick up your penny and your suitcase
You're not a 21st century man

[Chorus]
Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow
(Tomorrow)
You still wander the fields of your sorrow
(Sorrow)
Tomorrow, 21st century man

[Outro]
(21st century man)
(21st century man)...



Mission (A World Record)
Mission (A World Record) LyricsThis is Yerffej Ennyl calling you from planet Earth

For many days, we travelled from a distant place and time
To reach a place they call the planet Earth
There was to be a celebration
On the mission of the sacred heart

The planet Earth from way up there is beautiful and blue
And floating softly through a rainbow
But when you touch down, things look different here
At the mission of the sacred heart
Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?

How's life on Earth?

(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)

When all the stars above
Lay icy fingers down on me
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)

On a dirty worn-out sidewalk, sits a mother with a baby;
In her vale of tears, she sees no rainbow
And someone's singing from a window
In the mission of the sacred heart

Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?

How's life on Earth?

(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)
And when the stars above
Lay icy fingers down on me
(Living on the Earth, living on the Earth
Living on the Earth, living on the Earth)

There's a building on a corner, in a city, in a land
On a place they call the planet Earth
My orders are to sit here and watch the world go by
From the mission of the sacred heart

Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?

Watching all the days roll by
Who are you and who am I?

How's life on Earth?
What is it worth?

I gotta see you, oh, oh
I know the way that I feel

Night in the City
Night in the City Lyrics[Verse 1]
Standin' at the airport, lookin' down the strip
She was dryin' her eyes, she was bitin' her lip
Seven-four-seven
Just left from gate eleven
And there's no turning 'round
'Cause it's just leaving the ground
And gettin' higher (Higher)

[Verse 2]
Standing at the dockside, looking out to sea
When I saw her, but she did not see me
There she stood with no hope
Because she'd miss-ed the boat
And as her dreams sailed away
She headed back for the day
Back to the city (City)
[Chorus]
Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

[Verse 3]
(In the city)
Ooh-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la-la
In the city (City)

[Chorus]
Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

[Verse 4]
I was running kinda lonely at the city place
I waited for an hour, I never saw her face
Crazy ladies that wait
And slide around like a snake
I just can't take anymore
I'm going in through the door
Into the city (City)
[Bridge]
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
I'll get you, yes, I'm gonna get you
Driving you insane

Night in the city, oh-oh-oh
Madness at midnight
Night in the city
Driving you insane

Driving you insane

Sweet Is the Night
Sweet Is the Night Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne]
When the day is done and there's nowhere to run
(Nowhere to run)
And the people of the city have all lost and won
In your city dress, you stand and stare
(You stand and stare)
And you smoke another cigarette and comb your hair

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kelly Groucutt]
And the light (The light) that shines (That shines)
Paints a trace of sadness
On the street (The street), I wait (I wait)
But I can't seem to get to you
[Verse 2: Jeff Lynne]
Oh, you start to sway, check your Cartier
(It's getting late)
'Cause it's getting late, you can't afford to wait
So you move along where it's going on
(It's going on)
And the people of the night are playing 'till the dawn

[Pre-Chorus 2: Kelly Groucutt]
And the sun (The sun) that shines (That shines)
Paints a trace of sadness
In your eyes (Those eyes) that cry (That cry)
Wishing and a-hoping, oh

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt]
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
Now you are near

[Verse 3: Jeff Lynne]
Well, you did your thing and you lost your wings
(You did your thing)
And you hurt so bad, you lost everything
And the tears that fall on the city wall
(The city wall)
Will fade away with the rays of morning light
[Pre-Chorus 3: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt]
(The light) That shines (That shines)
Paints a smile across your pretty face
(Your face) And I know (I know)
Everything is all right, hey, all right

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt]
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
(They disappear) They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
(Sweet is the night)

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt]
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near
Dark, dark were the days
(They disappear) They disappear
Sweet, sweet is the night
(Sweet is the night) Now you are near

[Outro: Jeff Lynne]
(Now you are near)



Boy Blue
Boy Blue Lyrics[Instrumental Intro 1]

[Intro 2]
We're all in the dream
The dream of life

[Verse 1]
Hey, Boy Blue, can't you hear all the noise?
It's for you, all the town's waiting there
Let us go, there's a show like you ain't seen before
Welcome home, where you been all these years?
Look around, all the crowd is in tears
It's so good to see you in the streets of your town
[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back

[Verse 2]
I've seen bold knights dropping down like flies
I've seen kings rolling in the mire
I've seen God point the finger of doom to our foes
I have fought in the holiest wars
I have smashed some of the holiest jaws
I've been jailed, been impaled
And been dragged through the world

[Verse 3]
One thing I have learned through these years
Is that no man should be stricken with fear
It should be that he walks with no care in the world
So my friends, who are gathered today
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say
That no man shall cause me to take up arms again
[Chorus]
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back
Hey, Boy Blue is back

The good intentions and the pain
Lay drowned now in the pouring rain
I tried to be so good this time
But here I am under the sky
(The good intentions and the pain, oh)
The good intentions and the pain
Lay drowned now in the pouring rain

Rainy day, ooh-ah-ooh

Four Little Diamonds
Four Little Diamonds Lyrics[Prelude]
Is this on?
Okay, after four...
Four!

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I used to think she was the greatest thing
I really cared, gave her a diamond ring
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me
Well, I never saw her face since then
[Chorus]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

[Verse 2]
She must be somewhere on the open road
She always said she was a lonely one
She gets you down with her tales of woe
She took me for everything

[Chorus]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Ooh, four little diamonds

[Bridge]
I looked around
I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But where could she run?
There's just no answer to give

[Instrumental Interlude]
[Verse 3]
I keep on wonderin' 'bout her, day and night
She probably thinks I was a fool, she's right
She don't know it, but I'm gonna
Keep on searchin' for that woman
I'm gonna search everywhere

[Chorus]
And if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Ooh, four little diamonds

[Bridge]
I looked around
I climbed up high into the dawn
But she was gone with the night
I thought about the things she said
And all the things we'd done
But she ran away, oh
There's just no answer to give

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I still hear her callin' out to me
I still listen for her endlessly
But it never even crossed my mind
She was a cheater
I gotta find where she hides
[Chorus]
'Cause if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds
Said if the law don't get her, then I will
Four little diamonds

[Outro]
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Four little diamonds
Hey! Four little diamonds
Hey! Four little diamonds

You were no better before
I sent a letter before
I sent a dream to you last night
From the end of the world

[Verse 2]
Oh you, you keep me hangin'
'Round and 'round and 'round and 'round
Oh you, look at the trouble I've found
[Chorus]
You were no better before (Whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before (Yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you last night
From the end of the world

[Bridge]
I saw you last night, but you couldn't answer
You were a lonely little sidewalk dancer
When I woke up, I could not stand it
You were gone, but I got to hand it to you

[Chorus]
(Whoa, whoa)
(Yeah, yeah)
(Dream to you last night)
(From the end of the world)

[Verse 3]
Oh please, if this is a game
I wish someone would win
Please, just let it fly
To me upon the wind

[Chorus]
You were no better before (Whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before (Yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From the end of the world
[Chorus]
You were no better before
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I sent a letter before
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From the end of the world

[Alt. Chorus]
I sent a dream to you, baby, last night
From then end of the world
I sent a dream to you, baby
(Dream to you, baby, last night)
From the end of the world

[Outro]
I sent a dream to you, baby
From the end of the world



Wishing
Wishing LyricsLittle darlin', don't you cry
You know, I'll try to be there with you by and by
When everything is going wrong, now don't you cry
I'm wishin'

Little darlin', far away
I see the world go rollin' by my windowpane
But I can only wish that I was there again
I'm wishin'

I wish that everything was gold
I wish you were here to hold
I'm wishin'
Little darlin', the night is long
I thought I'd be back now, I must have got it wrong
You and California call me in this song
I'm wishin'

I wish that everything was gold
I wish you were here to hold
I'm wishin'

Little darlin', I see you
You're cryin' in the sun, I gotta be with you
I'm gonna be there soon, I'll make it all come true
I'm wishin'

I wish that everything was gold
I wish you were here to hold
I'm wishin'



Across the Border
Across the Border Lyrics[Intro]
I've been workin' so hard, baby
Tryin' to get to you
I'm gonna be there soon because

[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne]
In the heat of the day many miles away
When the sun is beating down upon the main street
I'll be waiting here at the station
I gotta move down the line
They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done
You know I got to make the deadline
[Chorus]
I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write

[Verse 2: Jeff Lynne]
The Mardi Gras will be blowing strong
And the people dancing all across the city
I'm leaving here tonight
I gotta move down the line
I'm gonna catch a ride on the nine-o-five
I'm gonna ride the rails until we reach the morning
Maybe three or four hundred miles

[Chorus]
I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3: Jeff Lynne]
When the wind is blowing softly
Through the streets of a little town and the music's playin'
You're waiting somewhere over the horizon

[Chorus]
I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh
If I don't get to the border then I'll write
[Outro]
You know I'm comin', baby, Ooh-ooh-ah
You know I'm comin', baby, Ooh-ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh-ah
Ooh-ooh-ah



The Fall
The Fall Lyrics[Verse 1]
I see the early glow
I hear you say hello
I watch the shadows fall
I don't see you at all

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so)
It's a lie

[Verse 2]
I see the autumn rain
Falling on my window pane
I hear you say goodbye
I see a tear in your eye
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so)
It's a lie

[Chorus]
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know? I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on, really believing
I take the fall

[Verse 3]
I see you slip away
Into another day
There's no one else around
I watch the sun go down

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so)
It's a lie

[Chorus]
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know? I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on, really believing
I take the fall
[Instrumental Chorus]
I take the fall

[Verse 4]
I see you in a dream
You turn and start to go
I call to you once more
Guess that I'm taking the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so)
It's a lie

[Chorus]
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know? I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on really, believing
Our love couldn't go wrong
How could I know? I was only dreaming
And now, now that you're gone
I will go on, really believing

[Outro]
I take the fall



Eldorado Overture
Eldorado Overture Lyrics[Intro]
The Dreamer, the unwoken fool
In dreams, no pain will kiss the brow
The love of ages fills the head
The days that linger there in prey of emptiness
Of burned out dreams
The minutes calling through the years
The universal dreamer rises up above his earthly burden
Journey to the dead of night
High on a hill in Eldorado
[Instrumental]



Epilogue
Epilogue Lyrics[Verse]
You should be so happy
You should be so glad
21st century man

Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow
You still wander the fields of your sorrow

Then he arrives on this day of all days
May the world still remember him
[Outro]
Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time
Time (Time), time...



Waterfall
Waterfall Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne]
So now it's getting late, for those who hesitate, got no one
But they don't understand and no one hears the sound
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne]
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living
[Verse 2: Jeff Lynne]
Across the waterfall, that's falling evermore, down on you
Cascading through the days, and flowing on its way
That's how it has to be, just an illusion

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne, Jeff Lynne and Kelly Groucutt]
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair
But you know, as you hold, back the power there
Without the friends and lovers, you could never go on living4



Time of Our Life
Time of Our Life Lyrics[Verse 1]
Went down to London Town
To play our music at the football ground
"I can't believe this is goin' down"
I said to my friend Phil
60,000 rockin' out
And singin' loud, I had to shout
And best of all, they seemed so happy just bein' there

[Chorus]
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life
[Verse 2]
As we played on, it came to me
This could be the best night I've ever seen
The whole of Wembley singin' along
To every little song
60,000 mobile phones
Were shinin' in the dark of night
Wavin' and weavin', and boy, did they shine
When we struck up with "Telephone Line"

[Chorus]
(Oh, telephone line)
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life

[Chorus]
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
Oh, what a time
We had that night
We had the time of our life
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We had the time of our life
[Outro]
We had the time of our life
Time of our life



Above the Clouds
Above the Clouds Lyrics[Intro: Jeff Lynne]
Born in the heat of the night
Yeah, when things ain't goin' right
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You will remember me

[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt, both]
I came along to see your face
But the only thing I got from you
Was telling me it's fantasy
That you would always be with me
[Bridge: Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan]
I can tell you that it's true
I can tell you that it's true (Oh yes, it's true)

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne]
I'm waiting here
But it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
But it's alright with me
You better believe me now

[Verse 2: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt, both]
I guess it's like a mountainside
You've got to climb it to the top
Floating in a sea of dreams
The only thing that you can see

[Bridge: Jeff Lynne, Bev Bevan]
Is the view above the clouds
Is the view above the clouds (Above the clouds)

[Chorus: Jeff Lynne]
I'm waiting here
But it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
Still, it's alright with me
You better believe me now2

Welcome to the show

And again

Welcome to the show
Secret messages

[Morse code]
[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
A moving stream of information that is floating on the wind
The secrets never end
And now they call, they sing, they play
They dance for you from out of the blue
What can you do

[Chorus]
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
They call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere

[Verse 2]
Where words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky
Then I'll be there
I'll be there
When messages will call to you, there's secrets all around
Without a sound they're all around

[Chorus]
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
The call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere
They're calling everywhere
[Verse 3]
Those secret messages that spill into the air
From far away, so far away
A flowing river of illusion running with confusion
Never gone, it goes on and on

[Chorus]
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly
They call to me across the air
The messages across the atmosphere
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere

Secret messages
(The secret messages are calling to me endlessly)
Secret messages
(The messages across the atmosphere, they whisper in your ear) Secret messages

Laredo Tornado
Laredo Tornado Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer days, where did you go?
You've made me feel so bad
Clouds fill the sky, gone is the dream
My happy hunting ground
Wild buffalo played
And I never saw a rainy day
But it looks like summer days
Ain't coming back

[Verse 2]
March, April, May, June and July, ah
You took me for a fool
Big Chief, he lie, cold wind blows cruel, ah
So cold to make you die
Mountain breeze, ocean bay
And I never saw a rainy day
But it looks like them summer days
Ain't coming back
[Chorus]
Laredo tornado
Adios, amigos

[Bridge]
What can you do
When your dream world is gone
And your friends and lovers, too?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
West Winter Street, under the ground
The air that makes you choke
Towers of concrete, hellish go-round
Were there when I awoke
City sky pouring down with rain
That can never hope to ease the pain
And it looks like summer days
Ain't coming back

[Chorus]
Laredo tornado
Adios, amigos
Laredo tornado
Adios, amigos

Two drifters sailing wide and high

Mister Kingdom
Mister Kingdom Lyrics[Verse 1]
Daylight comes to those who live
But those who die, they never see
Sun come shining through their window pane
They pass away

[Verse 2]
Silly girl, to be a fool
You didn't play the golden rule
'Cause once you're through with one world
There's another waiting there
[Chorus]
Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mr. Kingdom, help me please
To find the rainbow's end

[Verse 3]
Looking from this empty room
The corridors of endless gloom
Go crawling through the night
To meet the dawn that's on its way

[Verse 4]
Oh, to sleep, perchance to dream
To live again those joyous scenes
The laughter, and the follies
That are locked inside my head

[Chorus]
Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mr. Kingdom, help me please
To find the rainbow's end

[Interlude]
Oh
Yeah, yeah
Yeah
[Verse 5]
I can dream of flying high
Above the city's cares
And never be afraid of anyone
'Cause there ain't no one there

[Chorus]
Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mr. Kingdom, help me please
To find the rainbow's end

[Chorus]
Help me, such a lonely soul
In dreams to leave behind the world
Mr. Kingdom, help me please
To find the rainbow's end, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, yeah

Poor Boy (The Greenwood)
Poor Boy (The Greenwood) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Me, I'm just a poor boy
From across the far south lands
And I've traveled many days
To reach this place to make my stand
Oh, and I fell in with a merry band
And drank away the hours

[Chorus]
Rollin' on
I've been rollin' on
And my head is high
From the battle won
Laid down my life
For the Greenwood
[Verse 2]
The city boys and the country boys
They come from miles around
To defy their king and country
Save the poor folks from the hands
Of the thieving dukes and abbots
And the gentry of the land

[Chorus]
Rollin' on
I've been rollin' on
And my head is high
From the battle won
Laid down my life
For the Greenwood

[Verse 3]
Sweet Maid Marion
Don't you do me no wrong
Stay on the right side
The Greenwood is your home
Oh, the dancing girls and the open fires
And the wine that flows like water

[Chorus]
Rollin' on
I've been rollin' on
And my head is high
From the battle won
Laid down my life
For the Greenwood



Need Her Love
Need Her Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
She gives me love that I
Could never hope to have
She tells me that she needs me
She tells me that she's glad
And if she goes away
I'm like someone
Who's left out in the rain

[Chorus]
I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love
[Verse 2]
She came in from the west
A summer breeze I couldn't rest
I had to take a fast train
To be there by her side
She made me feel so good
She made it like
It should be all the time

[Chorus]
I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

[Bridge]
Just when I
Was thinkin' of her
She came along
And made me want her

[Chorus]
I need her love
I need her love
I need her love

[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 4]
If she goes away
I'm like someone
Who's left out in the rain

[Chorus]
I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

[Verse 5]
The boats that sail
The planes that fly, she is with me
I wonder if she wonders
If this is all for real?
I couldn't stand to see
Her cry because of me
That would be sad

[Chorus]
I need (her love)
I need her (her love)
I need her love

[Verse 6]
She tells me everything
She makes me smile, she tries to sing
But never shares her suffering
If things are going wrong
She makes it like a dream
If things are as they seem
The world is good
[Outro]
I need her love
I need her love
I need her love

I need her
I need her love
Ooh, I need her love

Ooh, I need her love
Yeah, yeah, I need her love2

I thought I could turn things around
And show you something that was new
But all I got was disappointment
I was left without a clue

Bluebird Is Dead
Bluebird Is Dead Lyrics[Verse 1]
Little darlin' of my life
You keep movin' 'cross my mind
You gave me a sunny day
Now it looks as if I'll pay

[Chorus]
Why do they say - Bluebird is dead?
I can still see her, touch her, my Bluebird
The love that she gave, I don't believe
No, no, I don't believe

Waiting patiently for light
She said, "I know that you will grieve
But my darlin', I must leave."

The love that she gave, I don't believe

Please I cannot hear you speak
It must be that you're so tired
In the darkness of the night

The love that she gave, I don't believe
No, no, I don't believe



So Serious
So Serious Lyrics[Verse 1]
Night after night
I try to make it all fit together
Night after night
I see you as someone I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
You took me by surprise
Opened up my eyes
Now we gotta talk this over
[Chorus]
Can it really be so serious?
To be all broken up and delirious
I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?

Day after day
I know it's not the way that you want it
Day after day
I try to find the key, but it don't fit

But you know how it is
(Night after night)
No matter what I did

I guess we've really been out of touch
But can it really be so serious?

Kuiama
Kuiama Lyrics[Verse 1]
My, my Kuiama, she came in the morning
She smiled but the tears on her little face
Showed the pain that had been in that far-off place
So sad, treated so bad

[Verse 2]
My, my Kuiama, don't break your heart tryin'
To say how your ma and your pa passed away
And they left you to wander the ruin and decay
Real mean, that bullet machine
[Verse 3]
See here Kuiama, now ten thousand miles
Is a long, long way and you're here today
And you won't go back so you might say
"Hello, how do you do?"

[Verse 4]
Kuia, stop your cryin', there's no bombs a-fallin'
No horsemen in the night a-ridin'
Through your dreams and tearing at your life
Baby, goodnight

[Bridge]
No more silver rain will hit your ground
And no more guns will sound
No more life be drowned
No more trenches where the soldiers lie
And no more people die
Beneath that big black sky

[Verse 5]
Wake up, Kuiama, I got somethin' to tell you
It's just that I mean, well, that is to say
That I'm trying to explain but I'll start again
For you, I must be true
[Verse 6]
Kuia, in this country, they got rules with no reason
They teach you to kill and they send you away
With your gun in your hand, you pick up your pay
So cool, that no mercy tool

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 7]
Kuia, please believe me, I just couldn't help myself
I wanted to run but they gave me a gun
And they told me the duty I owed to my fatherland
I made my stand

[Verse 8]
Kuia, I just shot them, I just blew their heads open
And I heard them scream in their agony
Kuiama, she waits there for me
True blue, you saw it through



Nightrider
Nightrider Lyrics[Verse 1: Jeff Lynne]
I remember somewhere in the rain
The faces of the passers-by
Staring faces broken blinds
I recall the situation clear
Standing in a crowded car
I can feel the need in me

[Chorus: both]
Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on
[Verse 2: Jeff Lynne, Kelly Groucutt]
I still see that vision of delight
While cruising on the black of night
But she keeps a step ahead
Looking out the corner of her world
Nobody ever knows a girl
Who once lived along this way

[Chorus: both]
Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on

[Verse 3: Jeff Lynne]
Desolation degradation row
Go on; don't let the feeling show
She's a ten a penny dream
Faces with no name and no address
Keep staring in on my distress
But she kills me with her smile

[Chorus: both]
Hold on, nightrider baby
Hold on, you're a nightrider
Riding the night, searching for what is gone
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on



Calling America
Calling America Lyrics[Intro]
(Somebody)

[Verse 1]
Told her that there was a place like Heaven
'Cross the water on a 747
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
And pretty soon, she'd really got the notion
Of flying out across the big, blue ocean
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Ooh, in a modern world)
[Pre-Chorus]
Talk is cheap on satellite
But all I get is
Information, I'm still here
Redial on automatic

[Chorus]
(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
(Calling America)

[Verse 2]
But I'm just talking to a satellite
20,000 miles up in the sky each night
Yeah we're living in, in a modern world
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
All I had to do was pick up the phone
I'm out in space trying to talk to someone
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world
(Ooh, in a modern world)
[Pre-Chorus]
She left a number I could call
But no one's there, no one at all
There must be something going wrong
That number just rings on and on

[Chorus]
(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
(Calling America)

[Bridge]
(Dum-dee-doo-doo-doo-dum)
Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while
Guess she's missing me across the miles
Yeah, we're living in, in a modern world

[Chorus]
(Calling America)
Can't get a message through
(Calling America)
That's what she said to do
(Calling America)
That's where she has to be
(Calling America)
She left a number for me
[Outro]
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)
(Calling America)...

From Out of Nowhere
From Out of Nowhere Lyrics[Verse 1]
From out of nowhere
I see you come rollin'
I wonder how could it be real
I can't believe what you did
And you showed up here

Rain keeps on falling
And voices keep calling
But nobody knows where to go
You get the feelin' that
Everything's gonna blow

Let me go (Let me go)
Let me fly (Let me fly)
To a place (To a place)
That I love (That I love)
Let me fly away
And start again

From out of nowhere
I see you come rollin'
I know what you got on your mind
I would consider explaining
The plot would be kind

The streets, the signs are pointing all one way

Gonna write a little letter, gonna mail it to my local DJ
Well, it's a jumpin' little record I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven, gotta hear it again today

[Verse 2]
You know, my temperature's risin', need a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, my heart's beatin' a rhythm, shakin' out rhythm and blues
Roll over Beethoven, rockin' in two by two

Go get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up now
Go for cover and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven, tell Tchaikovsky the news

Well, early in the mornin' I'm a-givin' you the warnin'

The Bouncer
The Bouncer Lyrics[Intro]
(Four!)

[Verse 1]
Do you remember, you said to me
That you would wait, wait for me eternally?
I've been wondering and I've been hoping
You're still the same, only you can say
I'll be so glad to be back with you
I'll do anything you want me to
That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy back home
[Verse 2]
I see a light shine in my window
And I know I am coming home
And as the light grows, grows ever brighter
I see your face, you are alone
And when I tell you all things that I've seen
You'll say, "Darling, you must have been dreaming"
That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy back home

[Bridge]
Electric visions may cross
Strange decisions, of course
I felt the stars above me
I have someone to love me
That's what I want
I'll be so happy back home

[Verse 3]
Believe me baby, when I say
I wish I'd never, never, never, never, never been away
For the things that I see they ain't meant
For the eyes of our time
And when we walk alone together
That's how I want it to be, want it to be forever

That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy
That's what I want (What I want)
I'll be so happy

What I could never tell you then
And wander through the streets of yesterday

Birmingham Blues
Birmingham Blues Lyrics[Intro]
('Cause I've got!)

[Verse 1]
Working on the road
Across this great big world
Yeah, I've been rolling like a stone
I never get back home
Yes, I've been long-gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham blues
[Verse 2]
I've been across the ocean
To the south sea isles
Yeah, I travelled to the east and west
For miles and miles and miles
And I've been long-gone
Boy, I've got the Birmingham blues

[Chorus]
Across the world (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name

[Verse 3]
Oh, I wouldn't change the things
I'd do for anything
But I'd just like to hear the message
Of the streets again
Give me a ticket
'Cause boy, I've got the Birmingham blues

[Verse 4]
It may be kind of homely
But it sure is sweet
Industrial Revolution
Put it on its feet
But it's a long, long way
Boy, I've got the Birmingham blues
[Chorus]
Across the world, I've seen (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But with a different name

[Verse 5]
I'll go and stay a while
And all the folks I meet
They say, "You won't stay long
You got them travelin' feet
You'll soon be long-gone
'Cause boy, you've got the rest of the world blues"

[Chorus]
(Across the world) Across the world, I've seen
(People and places) People and places
(Everywhere I've been) Don't you know it could be the same?
But with a different name

[Chorus]
(Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
(Everywhere I've been)

[Chorus]
Across the world, I've seen (Across the world)
People and places (People and places)
Could be the same (Everywhere I've been)
But you know, it's got a different name

(People and places)

Oh No Not Susan
Oh No Not Susan Lyrics[Verse 1]
Susan spent the weekend at her stately home
Crying at the lions on the garden wall
And then she'd sigh - sneak away
Look at her style - free the day

[Chorus]
Oh no not me - I wouldn't
Oh no not me - I couldn't
That's all she says, her money and her place
They just don't mean a fucking thing
[Verse 2]
Susan met the lords and dukes of everywhere
Smiling, kissing, wishing that they'd go to hell
And then she'd laugh - wonder why
Take a nap - sit and cry

[Chorus]
Oh no not me - I wouldn't
Oh no not me - I couldn't
That's all she says, her money and her place
They just don't mean a fucking thing



Long Black Road
Long Black Road LyricsThey used to tell me, "Boy, you ain't goin' nowhere
With your cheap guitar and your big, long hair
You gotta realise all your responsibilities
You gotta get out to work and face reality."

You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road, long black road

So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin
I couldn't find my way, I didn't know what I was doin'
I saw a lot of people coming back the other way
So I kept on goin' when I heard them say
"You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road."

Long black road, long black road
Long black road, long black road
Long black road, long black road

I made a lot of money, I was makin' quite a mess
But they all told me, money wouldn't bring me happiness
"You gotta work like a man in a real man's life
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife."

You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road

You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road

You gotta get up in the morning, take your heavy load
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road, long black road, long black road



On the Run
On the Run Lyrics[Verse 1]
Whatever I do, wherever I go
The same afterglow is keepin' me low
D-d-d-don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay here too long

[Verse 2]
They see you go by, I tell you no lie
You're up in the sky, make everyone cry
D-d-d-don't wanna lose it
But don't wanna stay around here
[Chorus]
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say
When it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

[Verse 3]
I hear them talkin' and they go on and on
They think that nothing is wrong
And so they just carry on about you
D-d-d-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta move out of here

[Verse 4]
I see them waiting there for most of the day
I know you asked them to stay
But they just won't go away
D-d-d-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again

[Chorus]
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say
When it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again
[Verse 5]
I know it ain't real, but when you are near
You're sayin' the things that I wanna hear
D-d-d-don't wanna lose it
But I gotta do it again

[Chorus]
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say
When it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

[Chorus]
I'm on the run again
I'm on the run again
But it's like what they say
When it happens this way
You gotta do it again and again

[Outro]
Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run
Run around, gotta go, gotta run around
Run around, gotta go, gotta run
Woman, I gotta move around
Woman, I gotta get away
Woman, I gotta move around



Illusions in G Major
Illusions in G Major Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the seven seas
There was a phantom ship a-coming
Shinin' on the dead of night
I heard the crew a-hummin'
Tunes that sounded like
The Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen
They didn't know the words
So I assumed that they was foreign
No, no
[Chorus]
But I heard them just the same
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now
I said, doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now

[Verse 2]
I looked up in the sky
There was a phantom plane a comin'
Shinin' in the dead of night
I heard the pilot saying
Poems that were written
By John Keats and Robert Browning
He didn't know the words
So I suppose that it was nothing
No, no, no

[Chorus]
But I heard them just the same
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now
I said, doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now
Hey!
[Verse 3]
Oh doctor, please believe me
I know you won't deceive me
But do these things I'm seeing
Have any hidden meaning?
It's all good entertainment
It doesn't cost a penny
But please doc, let me teach 'em
If I could only reach 'em
My, my, my

[Chorus]
And I heard them just the same
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now
Oh doctor, let me teach 'em
I just want to please 'em, now



Latitude 88 North
Latitude 88 North LyricsThe iceman came to me tonight
So very near but out of sight
I heard the footsteps in the hall
And I heard a cold voice call
It's such a lonely world
Then I knew that you were gone
It came to me, I was alone
Now I'm left out in the cold
But the story's far from told
It's such a lonely world
It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me
Frozen shadows in the doorways
They will linger there always
And as the dawn begins to break
She's gone it's hard to take
It's such a lonely world
It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me
It's like Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me
Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me
Latitude 88 North
It's so cold, cold as hell
35 below and falling
How I wish that she was calling me



Don’t Walk Away
Don’t Walk Away Lyrics[Verse 1]

Are gathering to meet me

The feelings that I've never shown
Maybe I'll find the answer
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're gone, gone
How in the world will I go on?

Alone in the Universe
Alone in the Universe Lyrics[Chorus]
Alone in the universe
All alone in the universe

[Verse 1]
That's how it feels now you are gone
I knew it all along
I'm such a long long way from home

It only goes to show
I'm such a long long way from home2

When Time Stood Still
When Time Stood Still Lyrics[Verse 1]
Far beyond the things you see
Our time rolls on eternally
Got a thing about it
Just can't live without it

[Verse 2]
Sitting there inside your mind
Just waiting for the clock to chime
In a lonely land
Stood a lonely man
[Chorus 1]
No pictures on an empty wall
Nobody there, no one at all
Just echoes in the ivory halls
When time stood still

[Verse 3]
Days lined up outside the door
For time had stopped, there was no more
In a lonely world
Such a lonely world

[Chorus 2]
No pictures on an empty wall
No Toulouse, Vincent, or Pablo
Just echoes in the ivory halls
When time stood still

[Chorus 3]
No big machine or April showers
No submarines, no plastic flowers
Just echoes in the ivory towers
When time stood still

[Outro]
When time stood still
When time stood still
When time stood still2



Look at Me Now
Look at Me Now Lyrics[Verse 1]
Someone is waiting, lurking in the trees
The spirit of her is walking back to me
Ah, look at me now feeling emotion
Ah, look at me now

[Verse 2]
The King of the castle brought her to her knees
Gave the Salvation Army girl a squeeze
Ah, look at me now feeling emotion
Ah, look at me now
Look at me now
[Bridge]
Now she's a sallow face
Scattering her lace on dewy ground
Ah, I keep searching my head
Now it's spinning around

[Verse 3]
Lifting her head, her countenance redeemed
Re-acted the murder by the silver stream
Ah, look at me now displaying emotion
Ah, look at me now

[Verse 4]
Look at me now so cold and yet so brave
Weave me some wings to take me to her grave
Ah, look at me now feeling emotion
Ah, look at me now
Look at me now



Julie Don’t Live Here
Julie Don’t Live Here Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wander through a town
A town I knew so well
But it seems so strange
The wind blows cold
I remember when I thought your street
Was paved with gold

[Verse 2]
I walked along the street
A street I'd walked along
Many times before
But things have changed
Everything I ever knew
Was gone or rearranged
(Whoa, oh)
[Chorus]
Julie don't live here anymore
(Julie don't live here anymore)
She moved away many years before
(Julie don't live here anymore)
How can it be?
This I can't believe
Julie don't live here anymore

[Verse 3]
I walked up to your door
Last night, I saw your face
In the window
But it was different now
The lonely light where we used
To meet was gone

[Verse 4]
I thought about your smile
Your laughing eyes
And the things you said to me
I felt so sorry for you
For all the nights we spent hanging around
With nothing else to do
(Whoa, oh)
[Chorus]
Julie don't live here anymore
(Julie don't live here anymore)
She moved away many years before
(Julie don't live here anymore)
How can it be?
This I can't believe
Julie don't live here anymore

[Bridge]
Ah-ah-ah
Julie!

[Chorus]
Julie don't live here anymore
(Julie don't live here anymore)
She moved away many years before
(Julie don't live here anymore)
How can it be?
This I can't believe
Julie don't live here anymore

[Outro]
Julie don't live here anymore
Julie don't live here anymore
Julie don't live here anymore...



The Sun Will Shine On You
The Sun Will Shine On You LyricsYou've got to learn how to cry
Before you learn how to fall
You've got to turn from the darkness
And go through it all
Just remember that it's all right
It's all right to be true
And the sun will shine on you
You've got to try to remember
The promises you made
You've got to hold on to yourself
And never be afraid
Foolish notions try to get you
No matter what you do
But the sun will shine on you
Oh yeah, the sun will shine on you

Anything you want
You can have for your own
It was always there for you
If only you'd have known

Try to find it, try to love it
Try to see it through
And the sun will shine on you

Oh yeah, the sun will shine on you
The sun will shine on you
The sun will shine on you
Oh yeah, the sun will shine on you



Alright
Alright LyricsThe gold verandah in the dark has gone
Down to the metal man
No better time to leave the ground
And maybe try to understand

You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright

And through the darkest times of your life
You always tried to be the one
And now the times have made you wonder
If you ever knew what was goin' on
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

[Background:] Alright ... alright ... alright

It's no use thinkin' about what you ain't got
Just makes you bitter
And as you speak, everything that you say
Goes out on the big transmitter

You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright



Down Home Town
Down Home Town LyricsLlafretaw ythgim eht ecaf
Llafretaw ythgim eht ecaf
The world outside don't like us much
'Cause they ain't got our classy touch
But they ain't good enough to breathe
This town's good air, we make 'em leave

But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town
No monkey business in this town
Who do you think you're pushing 'round?
This town's respectable and clean
Just look around, you'll see what I mean

But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town

Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town
Down home town

But it's no, no, no
Really can't do that
No, no, no
Down home town

We got the best town band around
Just listen to their crazy sound
When they get hot, they gonna blow
You see them winnin' every show
Wish I was in the land of Dixie
Look away! Look away!
Look away! Look away!

Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town (Gotta get down, gotta get down)
Down home town
Down home town (Ooh, I think they're coming down now)
Down home town

But it's no, no, no (No)
Really can't do that (She loves you)
No, no, no (I can't do that)
Down home town

Wish I was in the land of Dixie
Look away! Look away!



Hello My Old Friend
Hello My Old Friend LyricsEarly morning day is dawning
Cooling towers and factory gates
Dirty streets and laughing people
Skinny dogs and beer crates
Hello my old friend
Hello my old friend
Sad canals, green-black water
Somewhere bicycles and beds
Wet and windy afternoons
And pigeons coo in garden sheds
Hello my old friend
Hello my old friend
High-rise tower blocks with panoramic
Views of trains and coal
Tiehead railway tracks tread faithfully
The gas works to behold
Hello my old friend
Hello my old friend
Just to see the sunset
Pretty rainbows over your majestic towers
To feel your earth beneath my feet
Here I could stand for hours and hours
[Instrumental Interlude]
Big machines that once were champions
Turn to dust under the sky
Broken windows choking chimneys
Factory walls for miles and miles
Bye bye my old friend
Bye bye my old friend
Just to see the sunset
Pretty rainbows over your majestic towers
To feel your earth beneath my feet
Here I could stand for hours and hours
Welcome to the show
Welcome to the show



Losing You
Losing You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Oh, I can't believe
That I'm losing you
Losing you
No, I can't believe
That I'm losing you
And it's true

[Chorus]
You always gave me everything I ever needed
Helped me see the hard times through
Now I'm losing you
[Verse 2]
Oh, I can't believe it's true
I'm really losing you
Losing you
The best thing I ever knew
I'm really losing you
What can I do?

[Chorus]
I always loved you from the moment we met, girl
You made me part of your world too
Now I'm losing you

[Bridge]
And now I find
You're always on my mind

[Verse 3]
And then the day will come
And I'll be all alone
On my own
And you'll sail away
And you'll be really gone
So far from home

[Chorus]
I always wanted just to hold on to you
And never ever be blue
Now I'm losing you
Yes, I'm losing you



Loser Gone Wild
Loser Gone Wild Lyrics[Verse 1]
I don't mind the pain or the joker's cold refrain
The days pass by so slowly, I count them all again
The silence of a basement, shades all closed at noon
(Loser gone wild)
Lie awake for fear of strangers
Darkness comes on slowly, twilight is the ecstasy
Like a candle burning bright, shadows dance until the light
Empty rooms and chilling smiles, ooh
(Loser gone wild)
They go on for miles and miles (and miles, and miles, miles, miles)
[Chorus]
But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild

[Verse 2]
I don't mind if violins don't play
I won't listen to them anyway
I don't care what people say (Loser gone wild)
Some things just can't be arranged

[Chorus]
But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But in the evening when the sun goes down
Crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town
Where the music is playing all across the night
And every cloud disappears from sight
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone
There goes another (Loser), another who's alone
There goes a loser (Loser), another loser gone wild
[Verse 3]
Icy fingers are touching you
Silent voices calling, too
What else is there to lose?
(Loser gone wild)
I'm here, but where are you?

[Outro]
(But in the evening when the sun goes down
I crawl from the shadows, gotta get into town)
(There goes a loser)
Loser



Mr. Radio
Mr. Radio Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hello, Mr. Radio, your friendly station
So glad of your company, your morning music
My wife, she ran away, she left our home
And though you're here with me, I'm on my own

[Verse 2]
Hello, Mr. Radio, your friendly speaker
You played my request today, request to see her
Your voice comes riding home across the air
You travel 'round the world, but still you're here
[Verse 3]
I heard on the news today, the world is no good
But if she returned today, mine could be so good
I look into the sky, your waves rush by
The weatherman has lied, it makes me cry

[Verse 4]
Hello, Mr. Radio, do I disturb you?
Sometimes I forget my place, I seem to know you
I miss you when you close, you'll never know
And when your programs go, I'm on my own



Stranger
Stranger Lyrics[Backwards]
You're playing me backwards

[Verse 1]
On a cold and windy morning
I said goodbye to my old friends
They were hanging 'round the corner
They were staying 'til the end, 'til the end
On the other side of midnight
I was looking for a place to stay
And one thing's sure for certain
I ain't never going back again, no more
(These strangers)

[Verse 2]
The streetlights looked so pretty
As they spread into a town
I was looking for another sundown
And my head was spinning round and round, round and round

[Chorus]
Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger (Stranger)

[Verse 3]
As I walked into the main street
I saw a crowd across the square
And I heard a guitar playing
And I saw you standing there, standing there

[Chorus]
Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger
[Verse 4]
Distant bells, they started ringing
Somewhere far-off in the night
And the place was full of loneliness
That disappeared from sight, ooh

[Chorus]
Looking through the eyes of a stranger
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Looking through the eyes of danger
Looking at the all-night dancers
(I'm looking through the eyes)
Never taking all of the chances of a stranger
(Looking through the eyes of a stranger)

[Instrumental]

[Outro]
I ain't never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
Never going back
